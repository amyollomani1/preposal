Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We created the part of the project which draws lines onto the screen for each character. The code can figure out if the user's input character guess was correct or not.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven't figured out how to read file on chirstmas songs. So the computer can't randomly generaty a word or sentence for the user to guess. We also havn't done the drawing the stick figure part yet.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The main problem is figuring out how to randomly generate a song lyric for the user to guess.
