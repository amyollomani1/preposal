# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

HangMan (Christmas Edition)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Hangman. The computer will generate a word/sentence that the user must guess.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The code will read through a file of popular christmas songs and use randomly generate a set of lyrics that the user must guess. For each character that the user guess incorrectly, a turtle will draw a part of the stick figure. If the entire stick figure is drawn, then the user loses.  

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Sharron Tunn
Email:  Tum91651@temple.edu
TA: Mrs. Nichols
## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will code a game called hangman that accepts user input and draws hangman or fills in the blnaks appropriatly ,

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be that the code can declare whether the user won or lost the game

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A best outcome would be that the computer can randomly generate the song lyrics which the user must guess. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

- I need to learn how to create a list of chirstmas song lyrics, generated from a file of chirstmas songs
- I need to be able to randomly access the lyrics in the list and be able to use a turtle to draw out the blanks for each character in the sentence. I will then write a code that accepts the user's input and write the correctly guessed character on the corresponding blank line.
- My classmate will draw the hangman portion. She will write the code that determines if the user's input character is incorrect and then use turtle to draw the corresponding body part on the hangman.
